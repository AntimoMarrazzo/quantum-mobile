# MARVEL Virtual Machine

This repository contains the vagrant and ansible scripts to generate the "standard" MARVEL virtual machine.

To generate the machine, first install the prerequisites:

- vagrant
- ansible

and then start the machine with `vagrant up`. This will require some tens of minutes as it will generate the machine from scratch.
