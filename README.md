# Quantum Mobile

*Quantum Mobile* is a Virtual Machine for computational materials science.

It comes with a collection of software packages for quantum
mechanical calculations, including

 * [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/)
 * [Yambo](http://www.yambo-code.org/)
 * [fleur](http://www.flapw.de/)
 * [Siesta](https://launchpad.net/siesta)
 * [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org)
 * [Wannier90](http://www.wannier.org)

all of which are set up and ready to be used through the
[AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net) python framework for automated workflows and
provenance tracking.

## Download the VM

Please see [releases](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases) for the latest VM image and installation instructions.

For issues encountered during installation of the VM, see the [FAQ](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

## Build it from scratch

You would like to add/remove some components of the VM
and produce your own modified VM image?
Then, the first step is to familiarize yourself with how the VM is set up.

This git repository contains all the vagrant and ansible scripts 
required to set up the VM from scratch.

### Prerequisites

- [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) >= 2.0.1
- [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- Host OS: Building VM tested only on Unix systems so far (MacOS, Ubuntu). Might work under Windows with a few modifications.

### Create Virtual Machine

```
git checkout git@github.com:marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile.git
cd quantum-mobile
pip install -r requirements.txt
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest  # optional, improves interface
vagrant up  # build vm from scratch (takes some tens of minutes)
```

### Create image
```
# optional: reduce size of VM
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars "clean=true"
./compact_hd.sh

./create_image.sh
```

### Useful commands

 * `vagrant provision --provision-with ansible`: re-run ansible scripts
 * `vagrant reload`: restart machine
 * `vagrant halt`: stop machine
 * `ANSIBLE_ARGS="-twannier90" vagrant provision --provision-with=ansible`: run ansible scripts for the `wannier90` tag
 * ```
   ./setup-ansible.sh             # inform ansible about ssh config
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml  # run ansible directly, add tags, ...
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml  --tags wannier90
   ```
 * ```ssh -F vagrant-ssh default```
 * ```scp -F vagrant-ssh default:/path/on/vm  my/path```

## Publishing customized VMs

If you would like to publish a customized version of Quantum Mobile, we recommend that you

 1. Fork this repository
 1. Give your VM a different name to avoid confusion
 1. Adapt `globalconfig.yml`, `EULA.txt` and `README.md` appropriately
 1. Pull the latest changes from time to time to keep things up to date

Last, but not least, [let us know](mailto:leopold.talirz@gmail.com)!
