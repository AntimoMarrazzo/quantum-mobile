In order to connect vagrant to a new VM in Virtualbox:

1. Get uuid of machine from: vboxmanage list vms
2. echo "<the-uuid>" > .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/id
3. Now 'vagrant ssh' should connect to the new machine
   (assuming that keys are the same)

If you already tried 'vagrant ssh' before, vagrant may have already deleted the
.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox folder (which contains, amongst other
things, the private key).

This is how you can back into your machine again:

1. Get uuid of machine from: vboxmanage list vms
2. echo "<the-uuid>" > .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/id
3. cp ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/
4. add the correct public key inside the VM ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ssh-keygen -y -f  ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
