If you play around with different VMs, vagrant can loose connection to the one
you are interested in. This is how you tell vagrant to connect again:

1. Get uuid of machine from: vboxmanage list vms
2. echo "<the-uuid>" > .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/id
3. cp ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/
4. potentially, also add the correct public key inside the VM ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ssh-keygen -y -f  ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
